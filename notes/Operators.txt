arithmetic operators:
shortcuts:
increment / decrement: i++, ++i, i--, --ide
modulo: % 
no exponential 


comparison:
&& and  
|| or

overloads:
operator overloading: user defined types just like fundamental Type
for example: 
int i = j + 3;
Order newOrder = oldOrder + newItem;
invisible, +, << and >>

operator overloads:
a) write a function that defines the operator
b) usually a member function
c) occaionally a free function

standard library has plenty of useful overloads:
1) they are invisible 
2) +  string
3) bit shift for cout and cin, << and >>
4) ++ iterator

we can overload all of the operators 


writing an overload:
MyObject < Something
