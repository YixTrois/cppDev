The Free Store:
- local variables go out of scope when the function ends.
- that's not always what you want
- the free store is for longer lived variables

stack is where the local storaged is kept. stack == local
heap is used for the free store.  heap == free sotre

how to access free store
1) create with new
2) returns a pointer to the object or instance
3) uses a constructor to initialize the object

when we don't need it
1) tear down with delete
2) uses the destructor to clean up the object

slightly different syntax for "raw arrays"
but modern c++ avoids "raw arrays"
